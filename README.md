# python_opencv_best_practices
This is a reference to what you might already know of opencv python.I'll be going through opencv docs and wherever i find that optimizations can be done i'll be adding those optimizations and utility classes.

1. Initial commit:
In initial commit, it contains basic image operations and video operations python code.
I have added one python module class which is CV2VideoWriter.py. This class gives you available codecs with which you can save your processed video because its difficult to find and test diffrent codecs available in system initially, so this class provides available codecs in your system.
